# üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Project README

Welcome to this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This document provides a detailed walkthrough of the EDA process undertaken for the dataset analysis. The aim of this project was to explore, clean, and understand the dataset to draw meaningful insights before moving toward more complex modeling. 

## üìù Project Overview

The goal of this analysis was to investigate the dataset, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and summarize the key statistics. The insights gained were used to guide future modeling steps. 

## üöÄ How the Task Was Carried Out

Here is the step-by-step guide to how the analysis was conducted:

### 1. **Importing Libraries and Dataset üìö**

**Objective:** Set up the environment by importing the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization. The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for exploration.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

**Libraries used:**
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** For visualization.

### 2. **Data Inspection üîç**

**Objective:** Understand the structure and composition of the dataset by examining the first few rows and columns, and checking for missing values.

```python
df.head()  # Display the first 5 rows
df.info()  # Summary of the dataset
df.describe()  # Statistical summary
```

Key checks:
- **Column types** to confirm if they are in the correct format.
- **Missing values** to determine if imputation or deletion was necessary.
- **Basic statistics** like mean, median, and mode for numeric columns.

### 3. **Data Cleaning üßπ**

**Objective:** Clean the dataset to ensure it is suitable for further analysis.

Tasks involved:
- **Handling missing data**: Depending on the column and the amount of missing data, missing values were either imputed (using mean, median, or mode) or dropped.
  
  ```python
  df.fillna(df.median(), inplace=True)  # Filling missing values with median
  ```

- **Handling outliers**: Outliers were detected using boxplots, and extreme values were either removed or transformed.

  ```python
  sns.boxplot(x=df['column_name'])  # Identifying outliers
  ```

### 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üî¨**

**Objective:** Explore the data visually and statistically to find meaningful insights.

- **Univariate analysis**: Distribution of individual variables was analyzed using histograms and count plots.

  ```python
  sns.histplot(df['variable_name'])
  ```

- **Bivariate analysis**: Relationships between two variables were explored using scatter plots, correlation matrices, and pair plots.

  ```python
  sns.pairplot(df[['variable_1', 'variable_2', 'variable_3']])
  ```

- **Correlation Matrix**: To visualize the strength of relationships between numeric variables.

  ```python
  corr = df.corr()
  sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True)
  ```

### 5. **Feature Engineering üîß**

**Objective:** Modify the dataset to improve its suitability for modeling. This step involved:
- **Creating new features** by combining existing ones.
- **Encoding categorical variables** to numerical values for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

  ```python
  df['new_feature'] = df['feature_1'] + df['feature_2']
  ```

- **Scaling features**: Numeric variables were scaled using standardization.

  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
  scaler = StandardScaler()
  df_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df)
  ```

### 6. **Model Preparation and Future Steps üîÆ**

**Objective:** Summarize the findings and prepare the dataset for machine learning.

- The cleaned and transformed dataset was saved for future modeling steps.
- Recommendations were made based on insights gathered during the EDA.
- Next steps include choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithms to build models based on the findings from the EDA.

## üíº Deliverables

- **EDA Notebook**: The Jupyter notebook used for the analysis.
- **Cleaned Dataset**: The final dataset, post-cleaning, ready for modeling.

## üí°

EDA is a crucial step in any data science project. By thoroughly exploring the dataset, we were able to uncover insights, address data quality issues, and create features that will feed into future models. This analysis set a strong foundation for the next phase of the project.

Feel free to explore the notebook and reach out if you have any questions!
